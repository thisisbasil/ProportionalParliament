# ProportionalParliament
A look at a parliamentary system that is fully proportional.

After going through the 2016 US elections and 2017 UK elections, I decided to look at what a parliamentary
system would look like if the various parties were given proportional representation, based of percentage of
votes.

The program takes a file as a command line parameter containing the needed info. It is in the form:



[Number of Seats]

[Party Name1] [Num Votes]

...

[Party NameN] [Num Votes]



It uses the strategy design pattern, so a number of different strategies. The one used will be documented in circprop.h.

Download all files into a directory and just make.

Hasn't been tested in Windows. If someone wants to try and post an executable, feel free.
